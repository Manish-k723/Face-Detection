# Face Detection Project
This project utilizes the MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model along with OpenCV to detect faces within images. By employing this combination of technologies, the program swiftly identifies and highlights faces present in the provided images. With its straightforward implementation, users can easily integrate this functionality into their applications for various purposes, such as image processing, security, or facial recognition systems.
